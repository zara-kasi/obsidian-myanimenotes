Cassette is an Obsidian plugin that syncs your anime and manga lists from MyAnimeList into structured Markdown notes, complete with metadata, cover image, and automatic updates.

### Get started

To authenticate with the MAL API, you’ll need to create your own application. You can follow the steps in this guide [MAL Authentication](https://github.com/zara-kasi/cassette/blob/main/docs/mal-authentication-guide.md)

After authenticating, use the Command Palette and run `Cassette: Sync all from MyAnimeList` or use the ribbon icon (Cassette symbol). Synced anime and manga appear in your chosen folder.
