# Cassette Obsidian Plugin

Cassette is an Obsidian plugin that syncs your anime and manga lists from MyAnimeList into structured Markdown notes, complete with metadata, cover image, and automatic updates.


### MyAnimeList Authentication

1. Create a MAL API application: [Complete Setup Guide](https://github.com/zara-kasi/cassette/blob/main/docs/mal-authentication-guide.md)
2. Open Obsidian **Settings** → **Cassette**
3. Enter your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**
4. Click **Authenticate** and sign in via your browser


After authenticating, use the Command Palette and run `Cassette: Sync all from MyAnimeList` or use the ribbon icon (Cassette symbol). Synced anime and manga appear in your chosen folder (set in plugin settings).
